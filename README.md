# PythonCML
A simple math library for pesky programming problems, like Project Euler


##How to get started?
Simply download the zip and add it to python with
```Python
import PythonCML
```

##Current Modules
Currently as part of PythonCML:
* Javascript Interpreter & Wrapper (Jispy)
* Prime Number Identification
* Sequential Maths and Functions
* Geometry & Trigonometry Functions

PythonCML was made for NSW ProgComp, it was tested with problems from the Euler Project.
